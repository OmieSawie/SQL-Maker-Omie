How the query is encoded into the url ?

Flat JSON meaning that we dont have to write the sql or there will be a single table?


Do we want a feature where a user copies and sends his url to another person and the other person is able to view it in the same table format?
  If yes: We need to use Quesy Parameters in the URL (We can add a step of compressing it before sending to look short)
          OR We can edit the url from frontend such that the url saves the page view and the api is called as per the page view
              AND we can send the Parameters in the body at the same time, which saves the time for compressing/decompressing the URL to get the params.
  If no: We can send the data in the body of the request.
